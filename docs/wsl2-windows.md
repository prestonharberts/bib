## bib â€“ WSL2 (Windows)

This script also works in WSL2 for Windows. Until I write the instructions here, I recommend following an [installation guide like Microsoft's](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), and then following my instructions to set up bib once you are logged into a Linux terminal on your Windows system.
